## Overview
In search for resources to better my front-end Journey, I discovered an amazing site that provides front-end developers with design files to replicate. This is one of the many solutions I have submitted so far. Do give me your feedbacks on how I can improve.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

- The project details and files were gotten from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
- I read the README file before starting the project, there I got directives on how to work out the challange.
- Afterwards, I wrote the HTML first then created a separate style sheet for my CSS.
- I used Figma to get the best judgement for margins, paddings and width.
- I used CSS media query to make it responsive.
- Then added JavaScript for Functionality

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries
- Plain JavaScript

### What I learned

From this project and many other projects I've completed, I've been continually learing the best approach to reproducing a UI/UX design and how to better handle a project.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to be able to combine my HTML and CSS knowledge with JavaScript to be able to build a flexible, responsive, functional and interactive websites, landing pages, blogs and a Portfolio for myself.

### Useful resources

- [Figma.com](https://figma.com) - This helped me to get the best judgement for font-size, margin, padding, width and border-radius. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
